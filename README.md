# Introducing Voilk (beta)

Voilk is a Delegated Proof of Stake blockchain that uses a "Proof of Brain" social consensus algorithm for token allocation.

# Quickstart

Just want to get up and running quickly? We have pre-built docker images for your convenience. More details are in our [quickstart guide](https://github.com/voilknetwork/voilk/blob/master/doc/exchangequickstart.md).

# Building

We strongly recommend using the latest binaries that we release, the latest ones, You can find them on the releases tab/section. 

However if you would still like to build from the source, we do have [build instructions](https://github.com/voilknetwork/voilk/blob/master/doc/building.md) for Linux (Ubuntu LTS) and macOS.


# Environment variables

There are quite a few environment variables that can be set to run voilkd in different ways:

* `USE_WAY_TOO_MUCH_RAM` - if set to true, voilkd starts a 'full node'
* `USE_FULL_WEB_NODE` - if set to true, a default config file will be used that enables a full set of API's and associated plugins.
* `USE_NGINX_FRONTEND` - if set to true, this will enable an NGINX reverse proxy in front of voilkd that proxies websocket requests to voilkd. This will also enable a custom healthcheck at the path '/health' that lists how many seconds away from current blockchain time your node is. It will return a '200' if it's less than 60 seconds away from synced.
* `USE_MULTICORE_READONLY` - if set to true, this will enable voilkd in multiple reader mode to take advantage of multiple cores (if available). Read requests are handled by the read-only nodes, and write requests are forwarded back to the single 'writer' node automatically. NGINX load balances all requests to the reader nodes, 4 per available core. This setting is still considered experimental and may have trouble with some API calls until further development is completed.
* `HOME` - set this to the path where you want voilkd to store it's data files (block log, shared memory, config file, etc). By default `/var/lib/voilkd` is used and exists inside the docker container. If you want to use a different mountpoint (like a ramdisk, or a different drive) then you may want to set this variable to map the volume to your docker container.

# PaaS mode

Voilkd now supports a PaaS mode (platform as a service) that currently works with Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk service. It can be launched using the following environment variables:

* `USE_PAAS` - if set to true, voilkd will launch in a format that works with AWS EB. Containers will exit upon failure so that they can be relaunched automatically by ECS. This mode assumes `USE_WAY_TOO_MUCH_RAM` and `USE_FULL_WEB_NODE`, they do not need to be also set.
* `S3_BUCKET` - set this to the name of the S3 bucket where you will store shared memory files for voilkd in Amazon S3. They will be stored compressed in bz2 format with the file name `blockchain-$VERSION-latest.tar.bz2`, where $VERSION is the release number followed by the git short commit hash stored in each docker image at `/etc/voilkdversion`.
* `SYNC_TO_S3` - if set to true, the node will function to only generate shared memory files and upload them to the specified S3 bucket. This makes fast deployments and autoscaling for voilkd possible.

# Config File

Run `voilkd` once to generate a data directory and config file. The default location is `.voilkd`. Kill `voilkd`. It won't do anything without seed nodes. If you want to modify the config to your liking, we have two example configs used in the docker images. [full node](contrib/fullnode.config.ini) ) All options will be present in the default config file and there may be more options needing to be changed from the docker configs (some of the options actually used in images are configured via command line).

# Seed Nodes

With latest build, we actually added the seed nodes in the config file,  but if you still need to add for some reason

`seed.voilk.com:3331`

This same file is baked into the docker images and can be overridden by
setting `VOILKD_SEED_NODES` in the container environment at `docker run`
time to a whitespace delimited list of seed nodes (with port).

# CLI Wallet

We provide a basic cli wallet for interfacing with `voilkd`. The wallet is self documented via command line help. The node you connect to via the cli wallet needs to be running the `account_by_key_api`, `condenser_api`, and needs to be configured to accept websocket connections via `webserver-ws-endpoint`.

# Building

See [doc/building.md](doc/building.md) for detailed build instructions, including
compile-time options, and specific commands for Linux (Ubuntu LTS) or macOS.

# Testing

See [doc/testing.md](doc/testing.md) for test build targets and info
on how to use lcov to check code test coverage.

# System Requirements

  - Linux Ubuntu 16.04
  - 10 GB Ram
  - 20 GB Disk Storage

On Linux use the following Virtual Memory configuration for the initial sync and subsequent replays. It is not needed for normal operation.

```
echo    75 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/dirty_background_ratio
echo  1000 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/dirty_expire_centisecs
echo    80 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio
echo 30000 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/dirty_writeback_centisecs
```

# Credits

Even though the code was changed (it was re-purposed) but it was originally created by the `STEEM` developers, so most of the credit goes to them :)
